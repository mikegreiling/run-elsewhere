# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions when using `run-elsewhere`.

## Permission Issues

### Ghostty/Warp: Operation Not Permitted

**Problem:**
```
Error: Failed to run command in Ghostty/Warp
```

**Cause:** Ghostty and Warp use System Events for automation, which requires Accessibility permissions.

**Solution:**
1. Open **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Find your current terminal app in the list (Terminal.app, iTerm2, etc.)
3. Toggle it **ON**
4. Try the command again

**Why is this needed?** Ghostty and Warp don't have public scripting APIs yet, so we use System Events to send keystrokes. macOS requires explicit permission for this.

### AppleScript Permission Prompts

**Problem:** Popup asking for permission every time.

**Cause:** First-time use of AppleScript with Terminal.app or iTerm2.

**Solution:** Click **OK** to allow. macOS will remember your choice.

## Detection Issues

### Terminal Not Detected

**Problem:**
```bash
elsewhere -c "npm run dev"
# Opens Terminal.app instead of my current terminal (iTerm2/kitty)
```

**Cause:** Terminal detection relies on `$TERM_PROGRAM` environment variable, which your terminal might not set.

**Solutions:**

1. **Force the terminal explicitly:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere --terminal=iTerm2 -c "npm run dev"
   ```

2. **Set $TERM_PROGRAM in your shell config:**
   ```bash
   # In ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
   export TERM_PROGRAM="iTerm.app"  # or "kitty", etc.
   ```

3. **Use interactive mode:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere -i -c "npm run dev"
   # Pick from menu
   ```

### "No supported terminal available"

**Problem:**
```
Error: No supported terminal available (exit code 75)
```

**Cause:** No viable backends found. Either:
- Not on macOS (only macOS backends implemented so far)
- Not in tmux/zellij
- No macOS terminals installed

**Solutions:**

1. **Install a supported terminal:**
   - Terminal.app (pre-installed on macOS)
   - iTerm2: https://iterm2.com/
   - kitty: `brew install kitty`

2. **Use a multiplexer:**
   ```bash
   tmux new-session
   # Now run elsewhere
   ```

## SSH Session Issues

### "SSH detected and not inside multiplexer"

**Problem:**
```
Error: SSH detected and not inside multiplexer; cannot open GUI Terminal (exit code 73)
```

**Cause:** You're connected via SSH. GUI terminals can't be opened remotely—they would appear on the server's screen (if it has one), not your local machine.

**Solution:** Use tmux or zellij:

```bash
# Connect via SSH
ssh user@server

# Start tmux
tmux new-session

# Now elsewhere works
elsewhere -c "npm run dev"
```

**Why?** Multiplexers run on the server and create panes within your SSH session.

### Mosh Connections

Same issue and solution as SSH. Mosh connections are detected via `$MOSH_CONNECTION` environment variable.

## Target Degradation

### "does not support panes; degrading to tab"

**Problem:**
```
⚠ iTerm2 does not support panes; degrading to tab
```

**Cause:** You requested `--pane` but iTerm2 doesn't support panes (yet).

**Solutions:**

1. **Accept the degradation** - It still works, just uses tabs instead:
   ```bash
   elsewhere --pane --terminal=iTerm2 -c "npm run dev"
   # Creates a tab instead (with warning)
   ```

2. **Use strict mode** - Fail instead of degrading:
   ```bash
   elsewhere --pane --no --terminal=iTerm2 -c "npm run dev"
   # Error: iTerm2 does not support pane targets
   ```

3. **Switch backends:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere --pane --terminal=tmux -c "npm run dev"
   # Use tmux which supports panes
   ```

### "does not support tabs; degrading to window"

**Problem:**
```
⚠ Terminal.app does not support tabs; degrading to window
```

**Cause:** Terminal.app only supports windows, not tabs.

**Solution:** Same as above—accept degradation, use `--no`, or switch backends.

## Exit Code Reference

When `elsewhere` fails, check the exit code for diagnosis:

| Exit Code | Meaning | Common Causes |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| `0` | Success | Command executed successfully |
| `1` | Generic failure | Backend execution failed, see error message |
| `64` | Usage error | Missing command, invalid flags |
| `70` | Software error | Backend not available (e.g., tmux not installed) |
| `73` | SSH/GUI infeasible | In SSH without multiplexer |
| `75` | No viable backend | No supported terminals found |

**Checking exit code:**
```bash
elsewhere -c "npm run dev"
echo $?  # Prints exit code
```

## AppleScript Errors

### "AppleScript is only available on macOS"

**Problem:** Trying to use Terminal.app or iTerm2 on Linux.

**Solution:** Use tmux, zellij, or wait for Linux terminal support (future feature).

### "AppleScript triggers permission prompts in remote sessions"

**Problem:** Running over SSH triggers AppleScript permission modal on local machine.

**Cause:** The SSH client (on your local Mac) tries to check for Terminal.app, which triggers AppleScript.

**Solution:** Use multiplexers in SSH (tmux/zellij). AppleScript is blocked in SSH sessions to prevent this issue.

## Command Execution Issues

### Command not found

**Problem:**
```bash
elsewhere -c "npm run dev"
# Error: npm: command not found
```

**Cause:** The new terminal/pane doesn't inherit your shell's PATH or environment.

**Solutions:**

1. **Use full paths:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere -c "/usr/local/bin/npm run dev"
   ```

2. **Source your shell config:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere -c "source ~/.zshrc && npm run dev"
   ```

3. **Use login shell:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere -c "bash -l -c 'npm run dev'"
   ```

### Special characters not working

**Problem:**
```bash
elsewhere -c "echo $HOME"
# Prints your current $HOME, not the new terminal's
```

**Cause:** Shell variable expansion happens before `elsewhere` sees the command.

**Solution:** Escape or quote properly:

```bash
elsewhere -c 'echo $HOME'  # Single quotes prevent expansion
elsewhere -c "echo \$HOME"  # Escape the dollar sign
```

## Interactive Mode Issues

### Menu doesn't appear

**Problem:** Running with `-i` but no menu shows.

**Cause:** Not running in a TTY (piped input/output).

**Solution:** Run in an actual terminal:

```bash
elsewhere -i -c "npm run dev"  # Good

echo "elsewhere -i -c 'npm run dev'" | bash  # Bad (no TTY)
```

### Menu shows but terminal is wrong

**Problem:** Current terminal is detected incorrectly.

**Cause:** `$TERM_PROGRAM` not set or incorrect.

**Solution:** Force the terminal after selection:

```bash
# Set in your shell config
export TERM_PROGRAM="iTerm.app"
```

Or just pick the correct one from the menu.

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Check the version:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere --version
   ```

2. **Use dry-run to debug:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere --dry-run -c "npm run dev"
   ```
   This shows exactly what would be executed.

3. **Check environment:**
   ```bash
   env | grep -E "(TMUX|ZELLIJ|SSH|TERM_PROGRAM)"
   ```

4. **Try forcing a backend:**
   ```bash
   elsewhere --terminal=Terminal -c "npm run dev"
   ```
